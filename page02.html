                Advance care planning involves learning about the types of decisions that might need to be made, considering those decisions ahead of time, and then letting others know—both your family and your healthcare providers—about your preferences. These preferences are often put into an advance directive, a legal document that goes into effect only if you are incapacitated and unable to speak for yourself. This could be the result of disease or severe injury—no matter how old you are. It helps others know what type of medical care you want.

                Sometimes decisions must be made about the use of emergency treatments to keep you alive. Doctors can use several artificial or mechanical ways to try to do this. Decisions that might come up at this time relate to:
               <br>
               <br> 
                <ul> CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation)</ul>
                <ul>Ventilator use</ul> 
                <ul>Artificial nutrition (tube feeding) and artificial hydration (IV, or intravenous, fluids)</ul> 
                <ul>Comfort care</ul>
